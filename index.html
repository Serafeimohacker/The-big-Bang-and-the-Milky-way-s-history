    <h1>The Big Bang and Milky way's history</h1>
    <p>The universe began with the Big Bang approximately 13.8 billion years ago, according to the <i>American</i> Museum of Natural History and the <i>American</i> Public University. This event marked the origin of space, time, and matter. Initially, the universe was extremely hot and dense, rapidly expanding. Over time, it cooled, allowing for the formation of the first atoms (primarily hydrogen and helium) and then, through gravity, the first stars and galaxies.</p>
    <p>Below is a table of the history and a preety cool video a YouTuber did about the universe's history</p>
